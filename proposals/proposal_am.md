# Implementation Proposal
This proposal outlines how Medhack can develop a simulator that will demonstrate how the different players in the medical industry affect the pricing of healthcare services. The proposal recommmends the following steps:
* Define the high level (Level 1) abstractions of the key stakeholders (company,industry,people)
* Define the attributes/properties of the entities defined in step 1 above.
* Define the sub-entities of each of the Level 1 entities and their attributes.
* Define the pay-offs of each stakeholder contextually.
* Define the linkage/connections between the different entities and attributes (Industries/Companies/People/Attributes) e.g: how drug pricing by pharmaceuticals affects the cost of medicare in hospitals.
* Develop the logic to implement the model (Using Game Theory) in code with the aim of demonstrating how equillibrium will be beneficial for all players rather than one/few players prefering the dominating stragey.
*  Create a visualization layer to add an interface and interactivity to the implemented model. 

## Proposed Tools
* GoJS (Visualization)
* NodeJS/JavaScript (Backend Logic)
* SQL (Data Storage Management)
